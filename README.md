## Purpose

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule, I WANT to add important events to a daily planner, SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
* WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day, THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* WHEN I click into a time block, THEN I can enter an event.
* WHEN I click the save button for that time block, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.
* WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist.
